Control WordPress Heartbeat API to reduce load. Allow, disable, or set custom frequency for Dashboard, Post Editor, and Frontend.

== Description ==

**Custom Heartbeat Control** helps you reduce server load by managing WordPress's built-in Heartbeat API. WordPress uses the Heartbeat API to make frequent background requests to `admin-ajax.php`, which can overwhelm your server especially on shared or VPS hosting.

This plugin provides a clean, user-friendly interface that lets you:
- ✅ Enable or disable Heartbeat API
- ✅ Adjust Heartbeat frequency (interval in seconds)
- ✅ Control behavior per section: Dashboard, Post Editor, Frontend
- ✅ Instantly apply changes without code

Ideal for performance-conscious site owners and developers.

🛠 No need to write a single line of code. Everything is controllable through the WordPress admin.

== Features ==

- Control WordPress Heartbeat activity from the admin panel
- Apply settings independently for:
  - Admin Dashboard
  - Post/Page Editor
  - Frontend (theme side)
- Choose from:
  - Allow (default WordPress behavior)
  - Disallow (disable AJAX polling)
  - Modify frequency (set custom interval, e.g., 60 seconds)
- Built-in protection to prevent unsafe frequency (minimum 15s)
- Lightweight and developer-friendly
- Clean UI that follows WordPress standards
- Redirects to settings page after activation for fast setup

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Heartbeat API? =
The Heartbeat API is used by WordPress to send periodic requests (every 15–60 seconds) to `admin-ajax.php` for tasks like auto-saving posts, syncing data, and showing logged-in user activity.

= Why should I control it? =
Frequent AJAX calls from the Heartbeat API can cause high CPU usage and slow down your site, especially if you or your users keep multiple admin tabs open.

= Is it safe to disable the Heartbeat API? =
Yes, but some features like autosave or post locking won’t work. For most sites, it's safe to disable or reduce the frequency in the Dashboard or Frontend.

= Will this plugin work with caching plugins? =
Yes! This plugin complements performance optimization tools like WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, or LiteSpeed Cache.
